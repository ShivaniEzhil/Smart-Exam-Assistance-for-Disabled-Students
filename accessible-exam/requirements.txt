# NOTE: pyttsx3, SpeechRecognition, and PyAudio have been
# removed.  Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text now run
# entirely in the browser via the Web Speech API, which:
#   - Eliminates server blocking
#   - Provides instant, real-time responses
#   - Removes the need for PyAudio system dependencies
#   - Works offline for TTS (browser-native voices)

# Audio / Speech (for deaf/mute integration features if needed on server side)
